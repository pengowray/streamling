# STREAMLING Overlay app

Share whatever music you're playing on your stream.

How it works: 

- Streamling creates a local web server which you show as an overlay in OBS or your streaming software. It displays what music you're playing in a style you can customize. Streamling will automatically detect what music player you're using and display the song title and artist, transition when the song changes, and disappear when the music stops or is paused.

- Streamling is currently freeware. If you'd like a particular feature, consider reaching out and supporting future development.
